      <h2 class="subheading description">Description</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Chicken Katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe
        and can also be used to make Tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of
        chicken. Serve with white rice and Tonkatsu sauce.

      <h2 class="subheading ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
      <ul class="myUL">
        <li>
          4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch
          thickness
        </li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="subheading steps">Steps</h2>
      <ol class="myOL">
        <li>
          Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place
          flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat
          chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and
          then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in
          the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side.
          Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
        </li>
        <li>Serve with white rice and Tonkatsu sauce.</li>
